# Critical Rat / Quantum Rat v2

**A deterministic “simulation as instrument” research engine for agent behaviour, assays, tournaments, and analysis.**

This repo is built around strict boundaries and reproducibility:

* **World (ground truth)** steps deterministically.
* **Brain** never reads world state directly — it receives an `Observation` and returns an `Action`.
* **A single seed** controls the run; determinism is enforced via trace hashing in CI.
* **Assays** run headless (JSONL ticks + summary outputs), and **tournaments** are reproducible + fair.
* **Analysis** converts runs into tables + plots, and a **replay GUI** lets you inspect runs tick-by-tick.

## What’s in here

### Engine features (current)
* **Central RNG authority** + injected RNG streams.
* **Per-tick TickData logging** (JSONL) + stable hashing.
* **Determinism regression gate** (baseline hashes + CI).
* **Sensors → Observation contract** (no “position cheating”).
* **Physiology + neuromodulation** logged.
* **Criticality field** + avalanche detection + κ (kappa).
* **TRN gating**, microsleep + replay gating.
* **Spatial system** driven purely by egomotion (HD + grid integrator + place id).
* **Working memory** (bounded) + deterministic basal ganglia action selection.
* **Action-driven world movement** (no random wandering).

### Assays / Protocols (headless)
* `open_field`
* `t_maze`
* `morris_water_maze`
* `survival_arena`

### Tournaments
* **AgentDNA** + deterministic fingerprinting.
* **TournamentManager** + CLI runner.
* **Fairness:** Same environment/protocol seeds across agents; only agent offsets differ.
* **Stable leaderboard** ordering with explicit tie-break.

### Analysis
* Extract tournament/experiment runs to **Parquet**.
* Compute κ distribution, avalanche distributions, sleep/replay rates, score distributions.
* Generate `analysis/report/report.md` + plots.

### Replay GUI (read-only)
* Browse run directories.
* Select episode (agent + protocol).
* Scrub ticks (paged JSONL).
* Basic plots (kappa, avalanche, sleep/replay, spatial trace, actions).
